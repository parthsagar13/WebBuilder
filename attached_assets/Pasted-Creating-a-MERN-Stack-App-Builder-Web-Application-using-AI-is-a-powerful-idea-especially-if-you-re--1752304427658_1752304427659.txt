Here‚Äôs a feature roadmap, tools you can use, and free AI APIs you can integrate:

üîß Core Features for Your SaaS App
User Authentication (JWT, Google Login, etc.)

AI-powered App Generator

Users enter prompts like: "Create a blog with login, post creation, and comments"

Component Library Integration

Choose between UI libraries like Tailwind, Bootstrap, Material UI

Live Preview

Render generated code live using an iframe or sandbox

Download as ZIP

Package generated code into a downloadable ZIP file

Project Storage

Save user projects for editing later

Export to GitHub

Connect GitHub to export code repositories

üß† AI Use Cases & Free APIs
1. Code Generation (Frontend + Backend)
Use:

OpenAI GPT-4o (via API) ‚Äì prompt: ‚ÄúGenerate a MERN stack login page with MongoDB schema‚Äù

Replit Ghostwriter (limited free) ‚Äì for code completions

CodeGeeX ‚Äì Open-source code generation model (free API)

2. UI Design to Code (Optional)
Use:

Uizard Autodesigner (freemium) or Builder.io

Or train your own small ML model with basic HTML layout templates

3. Live Preview Engine
Use:

Sandpack by CodeSandbox ‚Äì render React projects live in-browser

4. Zip File Generator
